### What is Trickle

Trickle is a simple app which enters the Android OS Low-Power mode when the screen is off,
and leaves Low-Power mode when the screen is on. If your device is already is Low-Power
mode, or it is being charged, Trickle will not do anything.

required to use the application or any features.
